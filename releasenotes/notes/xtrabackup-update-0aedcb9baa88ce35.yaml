fixes:
  - MariaDB 10.0.32 released on Aug 17 which, when configured
    to use xtrabackup for the SST, requires percona xtrabackup
    version 2.3.5 or higher. As xtrabackup is the default SST
    mechanism in the ``galera_server`` role, the version used
    has been updated from 2.2.13 to 2.3.5 for the x86_64
    hardware architecture. See `the percona release notes for
    2.3.2 <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/LATEST/release-notes/2.3/2.3.2.html#new-features>`_
    for more details of what was included in the fix.
